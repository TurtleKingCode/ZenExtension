# ZenExtension
Replicating the ScreenZen app's functionality in a Chrome Extension

Sick and tired of not having a browser extension equivalent to the ScreenZen app functionality, I decided to take matters into my own hands and make my own.

This project will start out very barebones as I will add only the features that I want to use. Afterwards, I will add features to it hopefully to achieve feature pareity with the ScreenZen app.

I will preface that I nor this project is in no way affiliated with ScreenZen. I merely loved the features of their app and wanted it in my browser.
